    "title": "Space or Speed? The YANMAR X47 Has Both",
    "article": "The secret of the X47’s speed is three V8 turbo diesel engines set in a triple sterndrive configuration.  Normally powerboats use two propellers set in the rear of the craft that are rotationally opposed to one another. This triple sterndrive utilizes sets of stacked, counter-rotating propellers. While difficult to accomplish from an engineering standpoint, it gives the X47 fantastic acceleration—the top speed is a blistering 40 knots—as well as nimble maneuvering ability. One of the main criticisms about watercraft that use a triple-engine configuration is the noise. The X47 doesn’t have this issue since the power plants, YANMAR’s 8LV marine diesels, are known for their smooth and quiet performance. House them in a soundproofed engine room and the result is a quiet, luxurious experience at sea. The triple sterndrive configuration also means the X47 is highly maneuverable. The helm is characterized by a large touchscreen panel that delivers engine data, a fly-by-wire throttle system, and a joystick-based docking system. Paired with the X47’s torque and that triple sterndrive system, this helm layout provides captains with an unmatched level of confidence when maneuvering within a marina—a pain point for even the most experienced skippers.\n\nYANMAR was selected as an official marine partner of the 36th America’s Cup presented by Prada and the X47 was designated as the Official VIP Cruiser. How did that happen? “This is a new category of boat,” says world-renowned industrial designer Ken Okuyama, the creative vision behind the X47. “It has the beautiful styling of a powerboat but when you actually go inside, it has the large space of a cruiser.” Calling the styling of the X47 “beautiful” is something of an understatement. By partnering with Italian yacht maker Azimut, YANMAR created an interior that feels luxurious but also inviting. It’s spacious too: up to seven guests can spend the night on the X47 thanks to a pair of en-suite rooms. A dozen people can fit comfortably in navigation. Additionally, there are three separate lounge spaces for guests aboard the 47-foot boat as well as a master bedroom. The X47 will never feel crowded.",

    "article": "Delta Air Lines on Wednesday joined domestic competitors American and United in scaling back flights between the U.S. and China in response to a growing and deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe coronavirus has sickened more than 6,000 and killed at least 132 in China.\n\nThe airline said it would cut its weekly flights in half between the two countries, from 42 to 21, beginning Feb. 6 and lasting through April 30. That period lasts longer than American's and United's. \n\nAmerican's suspension, announced earlier Wednesday, lasts nearly seven weeks. On Tuesday, United said it would cut 24 flights between the U.S. and China for the first week of February.\n\nDelta's cuts include service between Beijing and Detroit and Seattle; as well as between Shanghai and Los Angeles, Seattle, Detroit and Atlanta. Rather than operate daily, those flights will operate three to four times a week, the airline said.",

    "article": "In 1348, Venice established the first official quarantine system in order to keep the bubonic plague, or \"Black Death\" from spreading through its ports. A Venetian council was given the authority to prevent ships, cargo, and people suspected of infection from entering the city for 40 days.\n\nDuring this time, the city built a holding center on an island off the coast, where infected individuals were sent to either wait out their 40 day trial, or die. This isolation period became known as quarantinario, taken from the Italian word for 40. Thus, the first official \"quarantine\" was born.\n\nBut these efforts hardly stopped the disease from spreading. The Black Death ultimately killed of 15 million people — about one-fifth of the population across Europe.",
